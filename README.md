# Predicting-fraudulent-transactions

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in a large financial dataset containing over 6.3 million records. The dataset includes features such as transaction amount, balances, and transaction type. After performing data cleaning, outlier removal, and one-hot encoding for categorical variables, a Random Forest Classifier was trained. The model achieved high accuracy, with an F1-score of 0.83 for fraud detection. The model was saved for future use, and feature importance was analyzed.
